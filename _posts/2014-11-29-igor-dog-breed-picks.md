## Beagle

![Beagle](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1220.jpg)

> One of the most amiable hounds, the Beagle was bred as a pack hunter and needs companionship, whether human or canine. He loves to explore the outdoors and is an enthusiastic trailer. Given adequate exercise, he is a calm, tractable house pet. He is an excellent child's dog, gentle, incredibly tolerant and always ready to join in a game or an adventure. He is an independent breed, however, and may run off if a trail beckons. He barks and howls.

> The Beagle needs daily exercise, either a long walk on leash or a romp in a safe area. He is a social dog and needs the companionship of either other dogs or his human family; as such, he is usually happiest if he can divide his time between the house and yard.

## Bichon-Frise
![Bichon-Frise](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1440.jpg)

> Perky, bouncy and playful, the Bichon Frise's happy-go-lucky outlook endears him to all. He is friendly toward strangers and other dogs and pets, and is very good with children. He is sensitive, responsive and affectionate, as eager to cuddle as he is to play. He can bark a lot.

> Although small, the Bichon is an active dog and needs daily exercise. His needs can be met with a vigorous indoor game or, better, a romp in the yard or a short walk on leash. The white powder-puff coat needs brushing and combing every other day, plus scissoring and trimming every two months. He doesn't shed, but the loose hairs become entangled in the coat and can mat. He may be difficult to keep white in some areas. This is not a dog that should live outdoors.

## Boston-Terrier

![Boston Terrier](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1450.jpg)

> The Boston is devoted and sensitive to its owner's wishes and moods. He is well-mannered indoors but saucy and playful (especially enjoying ball chasing) whenever the chance arises. Somewhat stubborn, he is nonetheless clever and learns readily. Some bark a lot.

> This is a lively dog that needs daily exercise and interaction with his people. He loves games, and most of his exercise requirements can be met with a romp in the yard or a short walk on leash. He cannot live outdoors. Some Bostons wheeze and snore, and many don't tolerate heat well. The coat requires only minimal care, an occasional brushing to remove dead hairs.

## Australian-Shepherd

![Australian Shepherd](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1020.jpg)

> The Australian Shepherd has a great deal of stamina and is loving, bold, alert, confident, independent, smart and responsive. If he doesn't get a chance to exercise and challenge his strongly developed mental and physical activities, he is apt to become frustrated and difficult to live with. With proper exercise and training, he is a loyal, utterly devoted and obedient companion. It is reserved with strangers and has a protective nature. It may try to herd children and small animals by nipping.

> This breed needs a good workout every day, preferably combining both physical and mental challenges. Even though he is physically able to live outside in temperate climates, he is a breed for which human contact is so vital that he is emotionally unsuited for a life in the yard. His coat needs brushing or combing one to two times weekly.

## Bulldog

![Bulldog](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1460.jpg)

> Despite his sourmug the Bulldog is jovial, comical and amiable, among the most docile and mellow of dogs. He is willing to please, although he retains a stubborn streak. The bulldog is very good with children. Most are moderately friendly toward strangers. The breed is quite good with other pets.

> The Bulldog appreciates a daily outing but cannot tolerate hot humid weather and should not be expected to jog or walk great distances, or to jump from any heights. Most Bulldogs cannot swim. Most Bulldogs wheeze and snore, and some drool. Coat care is minimal, but facial wrinkles (and any folds around the tail) should be cleaned daily.

## Curly-Coated-Retriever

![Curly Coated Retriever](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1660.jpg)

> The curly-coated retriever is an eager and tireless land and, especially, water retriever outdoors, but a calm companion indoors. She is sensitive and gentle, very good with children, and responsive to commands. One of the most courageous of the retrievers, she is nonetheless quite sensitive. She makes an ideal partner for an active, outdoor-oriented person who also wants a loyal family companion.

> The curly is an easy dog to maintain, requiring no unusual care. She needs daily exercise, preferably involving swimming and retrieving. She does best as an indoor, outdoor dog. Because brushing diminishes the tight curls, she should be combed only occasionally, preferably before getting wet. Some very minimal scissoring may be desirable to tidy up scraggly hairs. She does need regular brushing during her shedding seasons.

## English Springer Spaniel

![English Springer Spaniel](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1690.jpg)

> The English springer spaniel is cheerful, playful and energetic, ready for a day in the field and an evening by the hearth. He does everything with gusto and can be overly enthusiastic unless given plenty of exercise. The typical springer is the ideal family companion.

> As an energetic and inquisitive dog, the springer needs daily mental and physical exertion. An outing in the field, long walk on leash and good obedience lesson can go far to making the springer a calm and well-behaved house dog. This breed does best if allowed to live in the house with access to a yard. His coat needs brushing or combing one or two times weekly plus clipping and scissoring every three months. Springers from field, rather than show, lines tend to have less coat.

## American Water Spaniel

![American Water Spaniel](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1620.jpg)

> As his name implies, the American Water Spaniel is a natural lover of water. Not only is he a skilled retriever and versatile hunter, but is also a tractable fun-loving family dog, as long as he gets regular physical and mental exercise. He is sensitive and willing to please. Some can be timid. Generally good with other dogs in the household. Barking can be a definite problem; some also whine or drool.

> Like all hunting dogs, the American Water Spaniel needs daily exercise, although these requirements can be met with a long walk. The coat is oily and needs weekly brushing. Hair may be clipped from the feet and topknot. Ears should be checked regularly.

## American Cocker Spaniel

![American Cocker Spaniel](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1610.jpg)

> This breed is known as the 'merry' Cocker, and the name is most fitting. He is playful, cheerful, amiable, sweet, sensitive, willing to please and responsive to his family's wishes. He is not known for retaining his hunting instincts, but is inquisitive and will appreciate a country outing. He is equally at home in the city and will happily walk on leash for his exercise needs. Some bark a lot; some are overly submissive.

> Although he enjoys a romp, the Cocker can receive adequate exercise with a long daily walk on leash. The coat of the Cocker requires a greater commitment than that of most breeds, although pets can be clipped short. In order to maintain a nice coat, he will need to be brushed and combed two to three times a week, in addition to professional clipping and scissoring every two to three months. Special attention must be paid to ear and eye cleanliness in this breed. The profusely coated feet tend to carry debris. The Cocker is not mentally able to live outside; this is such a social dog that to banish him outdoors would not be acceptable. Cockers have a tendency to become overweight.

## English-Cocker-Spaniel

![English Cocker Spaniel](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1670.jpg)

> The English cocker spaniel retains more of her hunting nature than does the American version, and she also needs a little more exercise. She is cheerful, inquisitive, demonstrative, devoted, biddable, loyal and sensitive. This is a sociable dog that likes to stay close to her human family.

> Daily exercise is a necessity, either in the form of a long walk on leash, a good run in the field or a lively game in the yard. The English cocker is such a social dog that she does best living inside and playing outside. The medium-length coat needs brushing two to three times per week, plus clipping around the head and ears scissoring around the feet and tail every two months. The ears should be cleaned weekly.

## Cairn Terrier

![Cairn Terrier](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1920.jpg)

> The cairn is the essence of terrier; plucky, spirited, bold, inquisitive, hardy, clever, stubborn and scrappy. He is responsive to the wishes of his people, however, and tries to please; in fact, he is surprisingly sensitive. This breed is a good house pet as long as he is given daily physical and mental exercise in a safe area. He enjoys playing with children and is tough enough to withstand some roughhousing. He can chase small animals, he loves to sniff, explore and hunt. He digs; some bark.

> Despite his small size, the cairn needs outdoor exercise every day, either a moderate walk on leash, a fun game in the yard or an excursion in a safe area. He does best indoors. His wire coat needs combing once weekly, plus stripping of dead hair at least twice yearly.

## Border-Terrier

![Border Terrier](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1900.jpg)

> One of the few terriers bred to run with the pack, the border is one of the most amiable and tractable of the group. He is inquisitive, busy, friendly and biddable. He does like to hunt and can be independent, ingredients that make for a dog that may tend to roam if given the chance. He is generally good with other dogs and cats, but not with rodents. He is very good with children and makes a good companion for people of all ages. He digs, and some bark. Some are talented escape artists.

> The border likes activity and needs either a good walk on leash, a vigorous game session or an off-lead expedition in a safe area every day. He does best when allowed to divide his time between house and yard. His harsh coat needs brushing weekly, plus stripping of dead hairs about four times yearly to maintain his clean outline.

## American Foxhound

![American Foxhound](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1190.jpg)

> The Foxhound is well-mannered in the home. He gets along best with human or canine companionship. He is a tolerant, amiable and gentle dog, even though he is not very demonstrative. Many are reserved with strangers. He is first and foremost a hunter, ever ready to hit the trail. He needs daily exercise in a safe area. Once on a scent, he will follow gleefully, heedless of commands. This is a dog that likes the outdoors. He bays.

> The Foxhound needs daily exercise, preferably in the form of a long walk or jog. If allowed to run off leash, he should only do so in a safe, enclosed area. They are highly sociable, however, and should never be expected to live alone. The coat is easily maintained, requiring only occasional brushing to remove dead hair.

## Dandie Dinmont Terrier

![Dandie Dinmont Terrier](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1930.jpg)

> The Dandie Dinmont is no "dandified" dog; she is rough-and-tumble and ready for the hunt. Yet she functions well as a dignified house pet, affectionate but not doting. She is a loyal companion suitable for people of all ages, but she does need daily exercise to keep her from becoming frustrated. She is intelligent and very independent. Some dig.

> The Dandie enjoys the chance to hunt around and explore in a safe area and needs a moderate walk to stay in condition. She does best as an indoor/outdoor dog, and should sleep inside. Her coat needs combing twice weekly, plus regular scissoring and shaping. Shaping for show dogs is done on an almost continual (but light) basis; that for pets can be done by stripping or clipping about four times a year.

## Golden Retriever

![Golden Retriever](https://www.petfinder.com/images/breeds/dog/1740.jpg)

> Everybody's friend, the golden retriever is known for her devoted and obedient nature as a family companion. She is an apt sporting retriever as well and yearns for a day in the field. Ignoring her active nature and powerful physique can lead to behavior problems, and she needs daily physical and mental exercise. She tends to be overly exuberant and boisterous, and her enthusiasm for everything often distracts her during training; however, she is eager to please and enjoys learning. The golden's achievements in competitive obedience are remarkable. She especially enjoys games that involve retrieving and loves to carry items in her mouth.

> The golden retriever needs daily exercise and human interaction. Challenging obedience lessons, active games or retrieving sessions are all good ways to exercise the golden's mind and body. She is such a social dog that she is best when she shares her life with her family. The coat does not tend to mat but needs twice weekly brushing.
